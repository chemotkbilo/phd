Minion Pro

You can also obtain the font "Minion Pro".
If you don't have this font, it is easy to obtain for FREE:

Step 1: When \textit{Adobe Reader} is not already installed on your PC, download it for free at www.adobe.com and install it.

Step 2: After you install Adobe Reader on your PC there is a folder with fonts, (for example) at the following location: C: \ Program Files \ Adobe \ Reader9.0 \ Resource \ Font. 
In this folder you will find the Minion Pro font.
You can see the files MinionPro-Regular.otf, MinionPro-Bold.otf, MinionPro BoldIt.otf-and-MinionPro It.otf.
The font, however, can not be used yet by other windows programs from this location. Therefore, we still need to install it in the correct way.

Windows XP: Go to Control Panel and launch the utility "Fonts". Choose the option "Install New Font" and then browse to the font folder (the same as step 2) of Adobe Reader. When the correct folder is opened, windows showes the fonts in the folder. You can now install these fonts.

Windows 7: Open the directory where you downloaded the fonts (same as step 2) and look for all the files ending with .OTF. Both fonts Myriad and  MinionPro are visible. Select all files that start with Minion and then using the right mouse button menu, choose "Install".
