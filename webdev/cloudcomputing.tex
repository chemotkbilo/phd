\chapter{Cloud Computing}

\epigraph{Revolution, the biggest upheaval since the invention of the PC in the 1970s [\ldots] IT departments will have little left to do once the bulk of
business computing shifts [\ldots] into the cloud}{Nicholas Carr}

\epigraph{Computing may someday be organized as a public utility}{John MacCarthy, 1961}


\section{Big Data}

\chapter{Platform as a Service (Paas)}

Google Application Engine: Python, Java, PHP and Go, autoscaling

Shared Hardware

Cloud Storage )its object store)

NoSQL

MySQL

Apache Hadoop

Cloud Pub/Sub

Cloud Endpoints

Business analytics

including Big Query and Prediction API

Application Services

Maps

Translate

\section{Storing GAE data}

Many cell phone apps use GAE for their backend like Ruzzle and Tap Zoo

Fits GAE purpose well of being able to scale up for small teams of developers.

\section{summary}

Multiple reasons for cloud adoption

Clouds 


\section{Value of Utility Pricing}

Cloud services don't need to be cheaper to be economic!

Consider a car

Buy or lease \$10 per dat

Rent a car for \$45 a day

If you need a car for a 3 day trip, buyning wold be much more costly

\textbf{It depends on demand}


\chapter{Infrastructure as a Service}

Xen

\chapter{Protocol Buffers}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Invented by Google
\item Build on RPCs
\item Language-neutral, platform neutral
\item Extensible mechanism
\item Serialing Structured Data
\item For Distributed Services
\end{enumerate}

An example schema, you can start in Java and end up in PHP

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{protobuf}
//polyline.proto

message Point {
  required int32 x = 1;
  required int32 y = 2;
  optional string label = 3;
}

message Line {
  required Point start = 1;
  required Point end = 2;
  optional string label = 3;
}

message Polyline {
  repeated Point point = 1;
  optional string label = 2;
}
\end{minted}


\section{Thrift Network Stack (used by Facebook)}

Similar to Google Protocol Buffers. The \href{https://thrift.apache.org/}{Apache Thrift} software framework, for scalable cross-language services development, combines a software stack with a code generation engine to build services that work efficiently and seamlessly between C++, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, Erlang, Perl, Haskell, C\#, Cocoa, JavaScript, Node.js, Smalltalk, OCaml and Delphi and other languages.

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{protobuf}
enum PhoneType {
 HOME,
 WORK,
 MOBILE,
 OTHER
}

struct Phone {
 1: i32 id,
 2: string number,
 3: PhoneType type
}
\end{minted}
