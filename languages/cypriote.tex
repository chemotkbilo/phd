\section{Cypriot Syllabary}
\label{s:cypriot}
The Cypriot or Cypriote syllabary is a syllabic script used in Iron Age Cyprus, from ca. the 11th to the 4th centuries BCE, when it was replaced by the Greek alphabet. A pioneer of that change was king Evagoras of Salamis. It is descended from the Cypro-Minoan syllabary, in turn a variant or derivative of Linear A. Most texts using the script are in the Arcadocypriot dialect of Greek, but some bilingual (Greek and Eteocypriot) inscriptions were found in Amathus.

\captionof{figure}{The bronze Idalion Tablet, from Idalium, (Greek: Ιδάλιον), is from the 5th century BCE Cyprus. The tablet is inscribed on both sides.
The script of the tablet is in the Cypro-Minoan syllabary, and the inscription is in Greek. The tablet records a contract between "the king and the city":[1] the topic of the tablet rewards a family of physicians, of the city, for providing free health services to individuals fighting an invading force of Persians.}

The characters are \textit{syllabic}. There is one character for each  vowel, \textit{a, e, i, o, u,} and perhaps one for \textit{o}. There is no distinction between long and short vowels. The other characters represent what are called \textit{open syllables}\footnote{ If a syllable ends with a consonant, it is called a closed syllable. If a syllable ends with a vowel, it is called an open syllable. }, i.e., beginning with a consonant and ending with a vowel. 

No distinction is made between smooth, middle and rough mutes. The same character stands for τά τ\'ασs, δα in Εδαλιον ανδ δα ιν Αθανα  κε, κη, γε, γη, χε, χη. This fact constitutes the greatest difficulty in reading Cypriote.  

The Cypriot syllabary was added to the Unicode Standard in April, 2003 with the release of version 4.0.
The Unicode block for Cypriot is \unicodenumber{U+10800–U+1083F}. The Unicode block for the related Aegean Numbers is \unicodenumber{U+10100–U+1013F}.
